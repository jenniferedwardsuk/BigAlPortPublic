Well done, Al has now grown from a hatchling to a juvenile!
Now there's another question about dinosaurs which you need to make your mind up about.
How fast did Al grow?  Have a look at the <A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/howdoweknow/q19.shtml"">evidence</A> and then decide for yourself.
Remember that whatever you decide now will affect the next stage of the game.
So, how fast do you think <I>Allosaurus</I> grew? &nbsp;

Congratulations!  Al has now grown from a juvenile to a sub-adult.
Now it's time to make another important decision about how you think <I>Allosaurus</I> lived.
There is <A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/howdoweknow/q12.shtml"">evidence</A> that <I>Allosaurus</I> did eat sauropods such as <I>Diplodocus</I> and some <A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/dinosaurs/howdoweknow/q16.shtml"">evidence</A> that they actually hunted them rather than scavenged dead ones.
But did<I>Allosaurus</I> hunt in packs, and if so how many would there be in a pack?

Well done - Big Al has grown up!  The real Big Al never reached adulthood, but you've done better.  You now have the chance to mate. We have clues from the<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""""> <I>Allosaurus</I> brain</A> which senses they used the most, so we can use this to speculate how Big Al  might have tried to find a female and mate with her.
